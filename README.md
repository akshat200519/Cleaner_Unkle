CLEAN UNCLE:
This repository contains the code for a smart sorting system that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and computer vision techniques to automatically classify and sort objects.

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a system that can identify and sort objects based on their visual features. The system leverages computer vision to capture images of objects and a CNN model trained to classify those objects into predefined categories.

Potential Applications:

Recycling facilities
Warehouse automation
Manufacturing quality control
Dependencies
Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)
NumPy
Optional:

A webcam or other image capture device.
